# Computer Science 1 - Spring 2024

## Collection of Work

This repository contains my work for **Computer Science 1** at UCF during the **Spring 2024** semester. It includes various C assignments and projects that demonstrate my progression in the language and my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Assignments

### Assignment 0: Foster Home Naming System
- **Description:** Implements a foster home system where cat names are updated weekly based on assigned families. Each cat's name evolves as they move through different locations.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Leveraging the C string library
  - Using 2D arrays for name storage
  - Structs for organizing family and location data
  - String manipulation with `strcat()` and `strcpy()`

### Assignment 1: Bandit Baiting
- **Description:** Simulates a bait placement tracking system where food levels are monitored over time. Dynamic memory allocation is used to expand tracking structures as needed.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Dynamic Arrays and Resizing with `realloc()`
  - Structs for organizing location and food data
  - Linear Search for checking and updating locations
  - File input and output handling

### Assignment 2: Elephant Extraction
- **Description:** Implements a stack-based movement system for elephants searching for food in a grid. Elephants move based on food availability and backtrack if no food is found.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Singly Linked Lists for movement history
  - Stack Operations: Push, Pop, Peek
  - Dynamic Memory Allocation for grid storage
  - Recursive movement logic

### Assignment 3: Cozy Level Calculation
- **Description:** Calculates the maximum happiness level for a group of cats based on their relationships and initial comfort levels using brute-force combinations.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Recursive Functions for maximizing happiness
  - Generating Combinations of cat placements
  - Brute Force approach for optimization
  - Memory Management with dynamically allocated arrays

### Assignment 4: Business Buyout Simulation
- **Description:** Implements a simulation where a company attempts to buy out smaller businesses using a priority-based purchasing system. Merge Sort is used to order transactions.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Recursive Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort)
  - Implementing a Stack for tracking purchases
  - Dynamic memory allocation for storing shop data
  - Efficient data processing techniques

### Assignment 5: Corrupt Captors
- **Description:** Implements a system to track captured raccoons using an AVL Tree with hat-size-based promotions and rotations.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - AVL Trees and Self-Balancing Techniques
  - Treaps and Priority-Based Rotations
  - Recursive Insertions and Deletions
  - Tree Rotations for maintaining balance

### Assignment 6: Pet Food Distribution
- **Description:** Uses a Trie data structure to manage food distribution records for pets, allowing quick sum queries for different pet categories.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Trie Data Structure for fast searching
  - Inserting, Searching, and Deleting elements efficiently
  - Recursive Tree Traversal for data retrieval
  - Memory Management for dynamic Trie nodes
